# AOChaskell
<pre>
o green button - download zip
o unzip AOChaskell-main.zip
o cd AOChaskell-main
o sh FIRST_HASKELL.sh
   (it does everything)
   
-- notes:
o you are going to need cabal to install various packages aswell as ghc
   cabal instructions, first download then: 
   $ cabal update; cabal install vector
     (possibly other packages)
o ps and kill if you dont want to wait for one to finish (eg: 2018.day1.2 takes 30 mins)

-- my 2 cents:
   o Haskell doesn't have an ordinary for loop so there are a lot of recursive functions
   o you have to pass positions (within a list) and totals as parameters to these recursive functions
   o globals variables (they are pseudo) are not really an option
   o C style parameter types work well
   o Haskell doesn't seem to be super fast

-- i'm back in college until christmas so the upload gap will increase
